            When I first studied HTML(back in 8th grade...I guess?), I never knew that it was going to be this easy and fun.Back in school,I used to hate the idea of studying computer science.
            As a matter of fact,I even failed computer(even HTML :) ).And I never knew that years later, I would be striving to be a computer science engineer.
